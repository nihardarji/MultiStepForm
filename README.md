# Camino Financial's Take Home Project



Hello and welcome to Camino Financial take home project!

## The Mission

The mission, should you choose to accept, is to build a loan application page using React and Redux.

## Getting started

We suggest you use create-react-app to quickly set up your app : 
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

## Why a take-home?

This is a tangible way for you to show us:

* That you know react and redux.
* That you're excellent at making web apps look like the designs given to you.
* That your code is extendable & easy to read.

## The Mission Specs

The images of what we'll be building are provided on this repo

#### 1: Build the page according to the mockup provided ####
* I can toggle the help header
* I can only click the NEXT button if all the required fields have been filled (we suggest you add field validation too!)

#### 2: Use React with Redux  ####
* We would like you to use Redux for state management
* Clicking 'NEXT' should update your redux store

#### 3: Build reusable components  ####
* Even though you are only building step 1 of this loan application, you might have noticed there are 3 steps total... keep this in mind when building your components!

#### 4: Test your work  ####
* Don't forget to write tests, use the testing framework of your choice

#### 5: Help us review your work ####
* Your readme should let us know how to view your app
* Please remember to commit often so we can see how you're tracking...
